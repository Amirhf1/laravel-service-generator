# Laravel Make Service

Quickly generate services for your projects!

## Installation

Using composer:

```bash
composer require amirhf/laravel-service-generator
```

This package adds the `php artisan make:service {name}` command. The command generates an empty service class in
**app\Services** to get started. I made this mainly for own use because I like to be able to generate recurring files from
the command line to keep my workflow consistent.
